`# Password Strength Checker

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** implemented in Python. It evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria and provides feedback for improving password security.

## Overview

The password strength checker assesses the robustness of passwords by analyzing factors such as:
- Length
- Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Inclusion of numbers
- Use of special characters
- Absence of common or predictable patterns

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

(Optional: If there are any specific libraries used, include installation instructions here.)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrutishree2004/password-strength-checker.git `

1.  Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd password-strength-checker`

2.  Run the script:

    bash

    Copy code

    `python password-strength-check.py`

### Sample Output

The program will prompt for a password input and return a strength rating, such as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong," along with recommendations for improvement.

Functionality
-------------

-   **evaluate_strength(password)**: Analyzes the input password and returns a strength rating based on predefined criteria.
-   **feedback(password)**: Provides suggestions to enhance password strength, like adding special characters or increasing length.

Notes
-----

-   This tool is intended as a guideline and may not account for all possible password vulnerabilities.
-   Avoid using this tool to evaluate real passwords in production environments, as it is designed for educational purposes.
